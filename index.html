      <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
      <p>
        Hello!
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Julia, and I am a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I appreciate most about coding is the near-limitless potential of creation - and the satisfaction that comes from seeing the work through to fruition.
        I have always had a passion for solving problems and love to spend time writing clean, reusable code.
        Combining this innate curiosity
        Combined with my experience in client service, I always approach new projects with the user experience in mind.  This people-first mentality



        I take delight in solving problems, and



        Outside of the office, my interests include drawing, tabletop games, and long walks with my pug.

      </p>

      <p>
        When not working, I enjoy spending time drawing (recently added watercolor to the mix) and playing co-operative board games with my friends and family.  I am always on the lookout for tabletop game recommendations!
      </p>

        <h4>A review-aggregation app for popular media.</h4>
        <p>
          My work on this application was done as part of a five-person remote team.  We adopted many Agile practices - including daily stand-ups and Trello boards for workflow visualization.  Every part of this application is a separate module.  My objective was to build the image carousel, with a focus on clean and functional design.  I constructed the module with React and styled-components for a dynamic and animated experience.  Testing was done with Jest, Enzyme, and SuperTest.
